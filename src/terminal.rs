//! # Terminal
//!
//! The `terminal` module provides functionality to work with the terminal.
//!
//! This documentation does not contain a lot of examples. The reason is that it's fairly
//! obvious how to use this crate. Although, we do provide
//! [examples](https://github.com/rustterm-rs/examples) repository
//! to demonstrate the capabilities.
//!
//! Most terminal actions can be performed with commands.
//! Please have a look at [command documention](../index.html#command-api) for a more detailed documentation.
//!
//! ## Screen Buffer
//!
//! A screen buffer is a two-dimensional array of character
//! and color data which is displayed in a terminal screen.
//!
//! The terminal has several of those buffers and is able to switch between them.
//! The default screen in which you work is called the 'main screen'.
//! The other screens are called the 'alternative screen'.
//!
//! It is important to understand that rustterm does not yet support creating screens,
//! or switch between more than two buffers, and only offers the ability to change
//! between the 'alternate' and 'main screen'.
//!
//! ### Alternate Screen
//!
//! By default, you will be working on the main screen.
//! There is also another screen called the 'alternative' screen.
//! This screen is slightly different from the main screen.
//! For example, it has the exact dimensions of the terminal window,
//! without any scroll-back area.
//!
//! rustterm offers the possibility to switch to the 'alternative' screen,
//! make some modifications, and move back to the 'main' screen again.
//! The main screen will stay intact and will have the original data as we performed all
//! operations on the alternative screen.
//!
//! An good example of this is Vim.
//! When it is launched from bash, a whole new buffer is used to modify a file.
//! Then, when the modification is finished, it closes again and continues on the main screen.
//!
//! ### Raw Mode
//!
//! By default, the terminal functions in a certain way.
//! For example, it will move the cursor to the beginning of the next line when the input hits the end of a line.
//! Or that the backspace is interpreted for character removal.
//!
//! Sometimes these default modes are irrelevant,
//! and in this case, we can turn them off.
//! This is what happens when you enable raw modes.
//!
//! Those modes will be set when enabling raw modes:
//!
//! - Input will not be forwarded to screen
//! - Input will not be processed on enter press
//! - Input will not be line buffered (input sent byte-by-byte to input buffer)
//! - Special keys like backspace and CTL+C will not be processed by terminal driver
//! - New line character will not be processed therefore `println!` can't be used, use `write!` instead
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io::{stdout, Write};
//! use rustterm::{execute, Result, terminal::{ScrollUp, SetSize, size}};
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!     let (cols, rows) = size()?;
//!     // Resize terminal and scroll up.
//!     execute!(
//!         stdout(),
//!         SetSize(10, 10),
//!         ScrollUp(5)
//!     )?;
//!
//!     // Be a good citizen, cleanup
//!     execute!(stdout(), SetSize(cols, rows))?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! For manual execution control check out [rustterm::queue](../macro.queue.html).
